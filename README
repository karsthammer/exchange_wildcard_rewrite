Exchange Wildcard Address Rewriter
==================================

NOTE: This is a work-in-progress. At this moment it isn't usable!

Adds wildcard support to your Exchange 2007 server. This hook gives you the option to define e-mailaddresses with wildcards and rewrite them to another e-mailaddress.

So now you can say that all mail addresses to test*@mycompany.org has to go to test@mycompany.org
